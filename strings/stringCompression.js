/*Perform basic string cmopression using the counts of repeated characters. 
ex: aabcccccaa would be a2b1c5a2
if "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string (aka if all are 1 character without dups in a row)
Can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters
