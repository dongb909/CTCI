/* There are 3 types of edits that can be performed on strings:
    -insert a character
    -remove a character
    -replace a character
    Given 2 strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away 
  ex: pale, ple => true
      pales, pale => true
      pale, bale => true
      pale, bake => false
