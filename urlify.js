/*Write method to replace all spaces ina string with '%20' assuming that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
and that you are given the 'true' length of the string 
ex: input =  'Mr John Smith       ' 13
    output = 'Mr%20John%20Smith%20' 13
Thus meaning that the length of the new string should stay the same size
